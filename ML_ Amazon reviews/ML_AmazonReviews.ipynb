on many internet blog there where some minute bug which id expect to be sorted out with the next ui update notch the user can manage how the punch hole cam could appear according to his desire i dont like to hide it a it look good for me processor ram the qualcomm snapdragon g with ghz clock speed make the phone more reliable and very smooth the ram wa able to retain the cache of previously opened
